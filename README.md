Real-time accident prevention system using YOLO/MediaPipe and Arduino relay control
# AI-Based Accident Prevention System using Arduino

This project provides a real-time safety mechanism for Modular Manufacturing Systems (MMS) by detecting human presence near dangerous machinery using AI-based visual monitoring (MediaPipe) and stopping a 24V machine via an Arduino-controlled relay, buzzer, and LED alert.

## üß† How It Works

1. Webcam sends real-time video to Python program
2. MediaPipe detects human face/hand/pose mesh
3. If any landmark enters danger zone (Y threshold), Python sends `STOP` via Serial
4. Arduino receives command and:
   - Turns OFF relay (motor power cut)
   - Turns ON buzzer and LED
5. When danger clears, Python sends `START` to resume
